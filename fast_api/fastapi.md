# FastAPI Lessons

## About FastAPI
FastAPI is a fast solution to write simple RESTApi, if you want to build more complex API's, you should use another package or setup
With GraphQL + FastAPI is a great option for build more complex things, but will remain more limited.

## About
In this module, you'll be able to run your first fastapi module. I'll go learning and put my knowledge about FastAPI package here.

First of all, I put comments to follow the lesson from A to B. The main module is the main.py, and to understand the code you should read it from top to bottom.

If you want test it and run the code, put fast_api as workspace folder and run uvicorn main:app --reload

For test the api, you could use Hoppscotch.io like me or use the default UI from fastapi http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

### Model config and uses in the fastapi
In this section, when we use a path and uses models, you can use data from DB too. If an example extracted from the docs.
But if you are skillful you can add DB support too in models for return data.
